        <td><b>The AmJinu</b> - An Ecotel Hotel in Rajkot is Asia's first certified eco-friendly five-star hotel <b>and world's only Ecotel to be certified as ISO 14001.</b> This <a href="Room_Tariff.aspx" style="color:blue"><u>25 - room hotels</u></a> strategically located adjacent to the domestic airport making it a convenient place for the business traveler to stay.<br /> 
          
          <br /> 
          Everything is designed so as to be unobtrusive. Like The Club Privé room, an exclusive club floor with a private lounge and butler service. Or the well-appointed business and conference center to take care of your business needs in Rajkot.<br /> 
          <br /> 
          The exclusivity of <b>The AmJinu</b> is   experienced as soon as one enters the atrium that is serenaded by a 70-foot   indoor waterfall. Around the waterfall, on the first level is <u><font color="#8C2C34">the Boulevard</font></u>, the 24-hour coffee shop. The   beautiful <b>AmJinu</b> growing there give you a feel of the truly <b>AmJinu</b> experience.   Besides, The Boulevard provides a unique guaranteed time-bound service aptly   called the "Lightening Menu" or the "10 Minute Menu". If the service is even a   minute late, the meal is on the house!<br /> 
          <br /> 
          From the first level to the top   most.<br /> 
          <u>Mostly Grills</u> the lovely roof top   barbecue restaurant serves modern fusion cuisine. The setting is a very   surrealistic Mexican village with a pool by the side and the breathtaking view   of the airport runway on the other.<br />
