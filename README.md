# Hotel-Managament-System

                                  Objective:
The aim of this project is to build a system that
will able to automate many operations in the
hotel.

Modern day hotels aim to create a user
friendly atmosphere with the availability of hotel
employees who remember frequent visitors and
making it possible to call and make reservations.
While such hotels are extremely expensive, such a
service can also be provided in a cost – effective
manner with the use of computers.
        
                              Current System:
The existing system depends on many highly trained
individuals to take care of guests. Such a system is
prone to error and delays.

Visitors may not have a consistent experience and
have to be bothered about remembering mundane
things such as payments and restaurants.

A lot of paperwork is generated and it is difficult for a
supervisor to go through all these documents.
Allocation of rooms based on expected vacancies is
also difficult as it requires extra work on the part of
the employees. The costs of running such a hotel is
also great.

                              Proposed System:
The proposed system is much more efficient
in terms of human and monetary resources.
The number of staff to ensure successful
implementation is reduced.

Lead time of service is reduced and it is easy
to predict room availabilities. Electronic
documentation of hotel operations help
management in keeping the hotel in check.
   
                                Modules:
Admin: An admin can create data on the user
accounts for checking in and out and present
reports to management.

User: The user can book rooms. They will be able
present their mobile number to receive updates
from the system. Their preferences will also be
stored and accessed by this module for their
convenience in cases such as “forgot password”.
